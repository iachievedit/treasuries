# License

ChatGPT, when asked, "What open source license applies to the code you generate?" responded with:

> I don't "generate" code with an attached license. Instead, the code I provide in responses is original and generated based on the information and training I've received. When you request and receive code from me, you can choose how to license it.

Therefore, we'll apply the ISC license.

## OneDance Font

Searching for "a dollar bill font" led me to OneDance,
which contains the following `license.txt`:

```

commercial works too. But you can't sell them direktly.
